I'm Salman Shaikh — a **full stack app developer** passionate about building smooth, scalable, and user-first digital products. Whether it’s crafting beautiful interfaces or building robust backends, I thrive on solving real problems with elegant code.

> *"I code at nights while vibing to my favorite music."* 🎧

I love bringing ideas to life. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or sketching out my next app concept.
